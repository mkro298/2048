### Running the game 
In order to run the game, clone the repository to a local IDE, such as Visual Studios. Within the src folder, run the file Game.java. This will open the game in a pop up window where you can view the instructions by clicking on the instructions button and play as desired. You can exit out of the game and when you re-open it, your previous game play will have been saved.
